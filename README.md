MyBlogPost idea: <br>
We have decided to go with the blog post idea as the template for our website project. For our website, we will be going with a gaming blog post themed website, where people can make a post about anything gaming related. 
At a minimum, we want users to be able to view the website without signing in, however they will be limited only to viewing already posted blogs. Those users who are signed up and signed in to our website will be able to post blogs, comment on other blogs, change their personal info and, time permitting, be able to send direct messages to other registered users. For the administrator role, they will have more functionality within their account, which may include seeing all registered users’ usernames, the comments made per user and on what blog, their registration date etc. Although an administrator would have all of this information visible to them, we also want to ensure that user privacy remains intact, so they would not be able to view their password, address, real name, etc. Administrators will also be able to suspend users depending on their activity on the website. Upon doing so, they will have similar functionality to a non-registered user, as in they can only view the webpages without interacting with other users. An admin may unsuspend a user, but if the user does actions that warrant another suspension, they can receive a ban, which would lead to account deletion. Most of the user and admin abilities we also intend to implement are covered in the ‘project info’ canvas section, but the above is just a few highlighted points.

Although this might be an ambitious plan for this project, we will attempt to get at least the minimum functionality of having users register and post blogs, with an admin role to be implemented as well.
